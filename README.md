Much of human knowledge is “locked up” in a type of data called text. Humans are great at reading, but are computers? This workshop leads you through open source data science libraries in python that turn text into valuable data, then tours an open source system built for the Wordnik dictionary to source definitions of words from across the internet.
Goal: Learn the basics of text manipulation and analytics with open sources tools in python.
